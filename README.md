# life-history-on-islands
This is a repository for data and code associated with a broad project investigating life history ecology and evolution on islands. This repository will continue to change and grow as I develop my dissertation research.

To run the notebook 'mammal-trait-mapping-template', the following libraries need to be installed:
<dl>
  <dt>pandas</dt>
  <dt>geopandas</dt>
  <dt>matplotlib</dt>
  <dt>shapely</dt>
  <dt>numpy</dt>
  <dt>mpl_toolkits</dt>
